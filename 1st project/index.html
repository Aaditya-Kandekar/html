            <li><h3>History: </h3><p id="font2">Hunter Motorcycles was started with an intention to fill a niche for good looking learner
                    street bikes. The founder started the company as his own children came of riding age, realising
                    there was little choice of learner-specific bikes on the market. In 2014 the company was bought out
                    by Hunter distributor Ben Namnik and the headquarters were moved from New South Wales to Western
                    Australia.</p>
